        So You Might Be Wondering "What is Mein Bloggen?" Well, Mein Bloggen is a Blog
        Run By Me; Immanuel Salva. I Use This Blog to Post Arts, Stories, Videos and Other 
        Stuff. And if you're Wondering if I'm Using Wordpress Then NO, I'm Not Using Wordpress
        I Made my own CMS Because Wordpress Takes a lotta Space, So I'm a Pretty Good Coder
        Too. I am a Left-wing Political Activist That's Anti-Communist and Pro-Democratic-Socialist.
        And This is a Company Subdomain from one of My Companies so i'm also an Entrepreneuer and CEO
        of My Own Company.
    <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">What's In This Blog</h1>
    <p style="width: 40%; font-size: 20px;">
        Well To Explain What's In This Blog then Look at My Posts; It's Just a Categorized
        Mess of Posts. But to Go In Eveb Deeper Then I'll Explain: <br>
        This Blog is Used as a Video Blog and an Artist Blog Whilst at The Same Time It's also
        a Political and Story Blog. The Categorized Mess That i Mean is The Fact That Due to My CMS's 
        Limited Capibility Sometimes I Just Post Something and It Will Become a Huge Mess for Anyone
        To Look/Read to.

    <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">What's My Main Language</h1>
    <p style="width: 40%; font-size: 20px;">
        My Language Is Definetely Not Japanese and if i we're Then I Would've Spelled Hello With Herro
        and Say 'Igirisu' Instead of England, so Japanese is Checked out as a NO. I Speak The Cousin 
        Language of Malay and I don't mean Hindi. and yes Things Don't Rhyme But i Guess it's Fine, 
        So If You Guessed My Language Then Keep Your Mouth Shut.
